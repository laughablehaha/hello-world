# hello-world
The first repository

Hey, person reading this.

Hello, my name is Nathan. (That's not my actual name lol). This sentence really just outlined my personality, because I'm never serious, to the point where whenever I HAVE to be serious, nobody takes my word to heart! I know that is bad, and it feels off, but I guess I could use that to my advantage. I could rant on and on, but yep, this is my first ever commit to github!
